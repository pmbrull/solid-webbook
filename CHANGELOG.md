# Solid Webbook - Changelog

* 22/02/2020: Initial development. Users all log themselves into the same file address.ttl in the Webbook. Current issues: Security is solely achieved by append-only fashion in the file - which means that users are not able to unsubscribe! Content is not validated (schema-wise) and users could submit different webIds.
